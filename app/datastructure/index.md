# Omega(Ω) Notation
    - give the tigher lower bound of a given algorithm
    - we can say that for any given input, running time of give algorithm will not be 'less than' given time

# Big-O(O) Notation
    - give the tigher upper bound of a given algorithm 
    - we can say that for any given input, running time of give algorithm will not be 'more than' given time

# Theta(Θ) Notation
    - decides whether upper bound and lower bound of a given algorithm are same or not.
    - we can say that for any given input, running time of a given algorithm will 'on an average' be equal to given time.
