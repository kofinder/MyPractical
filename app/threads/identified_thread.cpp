 * Function: simpleFunc
 *
 * Purpose:
 * Demonstrates how a thread can "sleep" (pause execution) for a given amount of time.
 *
 * Explanation:
 * - std::this_thread::sleep_for() suspends the current thread for at least the
 *   specified duration. It does not guarantee *exact* timing because it depends
 *   on how the operating system schedules threads.
 * - Using 1s (from chrono_literals) means "1 second".
 *
 * Note:
 * The thread that runs this function will sleep for one second before finishing.
